# Code of Conduct for ODA development

|||
| -- | -- |
| **Prepared-By** | VS |
| **Status** | draft |
 
This note describes our collective understanding of how we coordinate the common open-source ODA initiative.

*this **code-of-conduct** is not a binding agreement by any legal meaning.*

*this **code-of-conduct** does not override any licenses provided with the code, as long as they are compatible with contractual rights of IP*

*this **code-of-conduct** does not override any contractual IP rights of ODA developers*

## Principles

We recognize that ODA is an inter-institute project, with different constrains on IP rights. 
As much as possible, involved institutions ([UNIGE](https://dataforum.unige.ch/t/recommended-license-for-open-data-and-software/201), SNSF, CNRS?, others?) encourage open publishing with attribution. We shall choose these licenses whereever possible.

These licenses will, ideally, define entirely the practices of code sharing and re-use, rendering the present **code-of-conduct** not useful.

The https://github.com/oda-hub repository is owned by the original developers of the code, and technical rights implied apply.


## FAQ

### Can I take part of the code and re-use it without asking original creator?

You can!
Since licenses are permissive.
If in doubt - please read licenses - they are the reference for this sort of answers.

### Can I take part of the code and re-use it without mentioning original creator?

?

### What if I contribute some code to ODA, and someone will steal it, embed in a different project and use it for their own good?

That's ok, that's what permissive license implies. Your stolen code will be, however, accompanied by original license and some attribution - reference to authorship.
